# Ecosystems Open Data Release

This open data release contains a postgresql database export of an [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms) service that can be used to recreate a copy of the service locally for testing, development, research or mirroring. 

The database dump was produced using `pg_dump` and can be loaded back into a postgresql database using the `pg_restore` command.
